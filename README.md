# CarpeDiem

CarpeDiem draws from patients in the Successful Clinical Response in Pneumonia Therapy (SCRIPT) systems biology center, a multi-investigator collaborative group led by Dr. Richard Wunderink and supported by a collaborative U19 award from the NIAID. SCRIPT is a multidisciplinary effort that involves investigators across disciplines at Northwestern. 

Comparing patientsâ€™ ICU stays is hard due to differences in length of stay, 
specific events, and therapeutic measures. Focusing on ICU-days allows data-driven 
identification of interpretable clinical states which can be used to compare data 
from important moments in patients' stays that lead to different outcomes.

Notebooks and code for the CarpeDiem project are available in this repository.
