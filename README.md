# CarpeDiem

CarpeDiem draws from patients in the Successful Clinical Response in Pneumonia Therapy (SCRIPT) systems biology center, a multi-investigator collaborative group led by Dr. Richard Wunderink and supported by a collaborative U19 award from the NIAID. SCRIPT is a multidisciplinary effort that involves investigators across disciplines at Northwestern. 

Notebooks and code for the CarpeDiem project are available in this repository.
